/** @class

  The RootResponder captures events coming from a web browser and routes them 
  to the correct view in the view hierarchy.  Usually you do not work with a 
  RootResponder directly.  Instead you will work with Pane objects, which 
  register themselves with the RootResponder as needed to receive events.

  h1. RootResponder and Platforms
  
  RootResponder is implemented differently on the desktop and mobile platforms 
  using a technique called a "class cluster".  That is, although you get a 
  RootResponder instance at some point, you will likely be working with a 
  subclass of RootResponder that implements functionality unique to that 
  platform.
  
  The RootResponder you use depends on the active platform you have set and
  the framework you have loaded.
  
  h1. Event Types 
    
  RootResponders can route four types of events:
  
  - Direct events.  Such as mouse and touch events.  These are routed to the 
    nearest view managing the target DOM elment.
  - Keyboard events.  These are sent to the keyPane, which will send it 
    to the current firstResponder.
  - resize. This event is sent to all panes.
  - shortcuts.  Shortcuts are sent to the focusedPane first, which will go down 
    its view hierarchy.  Then they go to the mainPane, which will go down its 
    view hierarchy.  Then they go to the mainMenu.  Usually any handler that 
    picks this up will then try to do a sendAction().
  - actions.  Actions are sent down the responder chain.  They go to 
    focusedPane -> mainPane.  Each of these will start at the firstResponder and 
    work their way up the chain.
  
  Differences between Mobile + Desktop RootResponder
  
  The Desktop root responder can deal with the following kinds of events:
   mousedown, mouseup, mouseover, mouseout, mousemoved

    should use a MainPane subclass, which will automatically make itself main
