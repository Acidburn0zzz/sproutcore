/**
  @namespace 

  Normally, SproutCore views use absolute positioning to display themselves
  on the screen.  While this is both the fastest and most efficient way to 
  display content in the web browser, sometimes your user interface might need
  to take advantage of the more advanced "flow" layout offered by the browser
  when you use static and relative positioning.
  
  This mixin can be added to a view class to enable the use of any kind of 
  static and relative browser positionining.  In exchange for using static
  layout, you will lose a few features that are normally available on a view
  class such as the 'frame' and 'clippingFrame' properties as well as 
  notifications when your view or parentView are resized.
  
  Normally, if you are allowing the browser to manage the size and positioning
  of your view anyway, these feature will not be useful to your code anyway.
  
  h2. Using StaticLayout
  
  It enable static layout on your view, just include this mixin on the view.
  SproutCore's builtin views that are capable of being used in static 
  layouts already incorporate this mixin.  
  
  You can then use CSS or the render() method on your view to setup the 
  positioning on your view using any kind of form you want.
